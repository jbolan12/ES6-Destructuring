# ES6-Destructuring

# React Car Stats App

This React app renders a table displaying stats for different car models, including their top speed and most popular color. The data is stored in a JavaScript object, and destructuring is used to access specific properties.

## Features

- **Car Statistics Display**: Renders car model data such as brand, top speed, and top color in a table.
- **Data Destructuring**: Uses ES6 destructuring to access data properties directly from objects, simplifying the code.

## Components and Files

### `data.js`

Contains the basic data structure for animals, each with `name` and `sound` properties. While not used in the main app functionality, it can serve as additional data.

### `index.js`

Main file where:
- Car data is imported from `practice.js`.
- Data destructuring is used to pull out relevant stats from each car object.
- The car stats are rendered in a table using Reactâ€™s `ReactDOM.render()` method.

### Data Destructuring Breakdown

- `const [honda, tesla] = cars;` extracts the Honda and Tesla car objects from the imported `cars` array.
- Nested destructuring is used to pull `topSpeed` and the top color (`coloursByPopularity`) of each car, allowing direct access to these properties for rendering.
